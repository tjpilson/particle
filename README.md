#Particle Boron Eagle CAD Library

The [Boron](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/cellular/boron-datasheet/) LTE is a powerful LTE CAT-M1 enabled development kit that can act as either a standalone cellular endpoint or LTE enabled gateway for Particle Mesh networks. It is based on the Nordic nRF52840 and has built-in battery charging circuitry so itâ€™s easy to connect a Li-Po and deploy your local network in minutes.

This library is for use in Eagle CAD to provide a pre-built schematic and provide a matching board placement template.
